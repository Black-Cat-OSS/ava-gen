when solving a bug, rely on the configurations at the root of the project. 

To solve the problem, it is often enough to perform the following actions::
- compare it with the requirements of the module (perhaps the module should behave this way)
- identify the circumstances under which the bug occurs
- double-check the file paths
- double-check the input data
- double-check the data types
- recheck classes (when using css, scss, sass, less) in markup and styles
- view the documentation of the package that is causing the problem
