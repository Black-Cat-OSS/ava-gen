when creating a react component, add the appropriate JSDoc documentation to it. 

Also, if the component is created in directories:
- features
- shared/ui/components
- shared/ui/layouts
- widgets
, then create a story for Storybook.

If necessary, wrap the component in the necessary contexts or generate a mock (without duplications in the project)
